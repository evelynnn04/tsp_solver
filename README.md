Hello, I am evelyn yosiana from K01 and this is a program to solve traveling salesman problem with ruby language.

The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is an optimization problem in which a salesman must visit a number of cities, once for each city, and return to the origin city with the minimum total distance. 

How to run? Edit the adjacency matrix and enter the command “ruby tsp.rb”, as simple as that.
